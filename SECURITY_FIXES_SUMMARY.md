# BPL Commander Security Fixes - Implementation Summary

## 🚨 Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **Plain Text Password Storage** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Passwords were stored and compared in plain text as a "legacy support" feature.
**Fix:** 
- Removed all plain text password support
- Enforced bcrypt-only password verification
- Added validation to ensure passwords are properly hashed
- Users with plain text passwords will receive security error message

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` - Removed plain text comparison logic
- Added proper error handling for unhashed passwords

### 2. **Hardcoded Default Passwords** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** All new users were created with the same default password "defaultpass123".
**Fix:**
- Removed hardcoded default password from frontend form
- Added strong password requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
- Added password strength validation with user feedback
- Users must now set their own secure passwords

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Removed hardcoded password, added validation

### 3. **JWT Secret Validation** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Application continued running even when JWT_SECRET was not configured.
**Fix:**
- Added proper JWT secret validation with error handling
- Application now fails fast if JWT_SECRET is missing
- Added environment variable validation at startup
- Improved error messages for configuration issues

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Added proper error handling
- `backend/src/utils/envValidation.ts` - New comprehensive validation system

### 4. **Database Connection Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Silent fallback to mock data without proper user notification.
**Fix:**
- Added comprehensive error logging for database failures
- Clear warnings about data persistence issues
- Better error messages for database connection problems
- Improved fallback handling with user notifications

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/services/database.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging

### 5. **CORS Security** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Overly permissive CORS allowing any local network IP.
**Fix:**
- Restricted CORS to specific allowed origins only
- Removed wildcard IP matching
- Added environment-specific origin configuration
- Improved CORS error logging

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Restricted CORS origins to specific IPs

### 6. **Input Sanitization** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** No input sanitization or XSS protection.
**Fix:**
- Added comprehensive input sanitization utilities
- HTML sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Email, phone, and URL validation
- Password strength validation
- File upload validation

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/utils/sanitization.ts` - New comprehensive sanitization system
- `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` - Integrated sanitization into auth endpoints
